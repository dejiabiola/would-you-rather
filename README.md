# Udacity: Would You Rather

A web app that let's user play the "Would You Rather?" game, built with React and Redux.

## Project Description

This is my second project in the Udacity React Nanodegree program. 

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

The user can also create new poll questions and answer them.

There is also a leaderboard page where the user can keep track his/her activities.
